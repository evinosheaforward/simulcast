            SimulCast is a card game where both players play their cards at the

                    If you have {CARDS_PER_TURN} cards in hand and have -1 draw

                Card abilities and values:
                <ul className="text-left list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-1 ml-2">
                  <li>The number on a card is its "value".</li>
                  <li>
                    Cards have the following types:{" "}
                    {Object.values(TargetTypes)
                      .filter((t) => t != TargetTypes.EXPIRATION)
                      .join(", ")}
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Cards can affect the value of other cards. For example Cloud
                    sets the value of the next damage spell your opponent Casts
                    to 0.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Some cards have effects that do not happen immediately.
                    Those cards have "triggers" and "expirations".
                    <ul className="text-left list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-1 ml-4">
                      <li>
                        Cards with triggers have conditions on when they
                        activate. For example, Sword will activate on any card
                        that deals damage (this includes, e.g. Bow).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Cards with triggers "expire". This means that their
                        effect lasts until a certain time. For example, cloud
                        triggers on a damage card from the opponent. It expires
                        when triggered, or at the end of the round if it doesn't
                        trigger.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Cards with triggers/expirations go into the "Ability
                        Queue". Cards are placed in the Ability Queue
                        left-to-right and they activate left-to-right as well.
                        For example, if you play Blood, Sword, and Goblet in
                        that order, Blood and Sword will be in the Ability
                        Queue. When Goblet is cast, first, Blood will change it
                        from healing to damage, then sword will increase the
                        damage by two. However, if you ordered it Sword, Blood,
                        Goblet then when Goblet is cast, Sword will not activate
                        because Goblet will still be a healing spell at that
                        point.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Abilities in the ability queue are not modified once
                        they are in the queue. If you play Crypt one turn and
                        you opponent plays Cloud the next, the Cloud will not
                        affect the Crypt trigger that happens at the end of the
                        round.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Strategize based on your opponent's patterns to win!</li>
